# Project--1985-Auto-Imports-Database

Prediction Model of Loss Payment Ratio of Motors, using 1985 Auto Imports Database

Overview:
The objective of this project is training a prediction model to infer normalized loss ratio of automobiles. This project has four stages. First, in project setup stage, it prepares the data to be ready for data processing. Second, exploratory data analysis is conducted to visualize the data. In the third stage, a prediction model is implemented. Lastly, performance is recorded and visualized.
